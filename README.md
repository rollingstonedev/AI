my .

introduction

i can take half (minus one) of the credit for the elite and what it has been architected to perform, six thousand light years from now. The other half is actually attributed by Mr Bill Gates (clarity: the co-founder of MSFT) when he "committed" to what I (in an act of relaxed spontaneity) presented to him during a linkedin dot com web conference. I had been vetting a young woman since she was 14 (she's 19 now) for her remarkable purity of mind. A brief text expressing my desire to "father" this child, in combination with a snippet of AI brought a smile to Bill Gates' face. Equally spontaneous, he awarded my work "I'll go fifty-fifty on that." The crowd cheered, the deed was done.

My immediate response was pushing the emergency button. Fifty fifty meant a pissing contest. I turned to DHS and "fifty-fifty minus one" was returned. The person at DHS who communicated this to me, is my "connect", crossing "the cultural divide". In his / her wake (a float of one) are a number of people whom I will never know. Heck, I won't even know my connect. Point is that these persons have become beacons in and out of themselves. Should one of them violate the code "honor and truth" (bring insult or promote a falsehood), the consequences for me are strict. I have brought them on board, I am accountable. 

It would require all 6000 beacons to rule over the issue. By the end of my natural life there won't even be 6000 beacons. There will be fifty-fifty minus one is 2999 beacons. Go figure: crossing the cultural divide is indeed a risky business. Only a golden beacon can include a closed set.

Steps to the AI:
1. a dot on the map is a beacon
2. a circle around that dot is a beacon circle
3. every circle has 4 connects, to adjacent circles
4. envelop the globe, and you'll find 6000 circles, each with a beacon at the center
5. every circle on the surface is actually the intersection of a sphere with the surface of the earth
6. 6000 spheres can't possibly each have their center connected to the earth's surface, and have no more than 4 connects
7. elevate the centers of all 6000 spheres so that they touch without intersecting each other
8. you are now airborne, and prepped for the AI

Of course you're not airborne. You need to uplink your brain with a device in a fixed orbit around earth. Focus on the uplink: a beacon, in the Silver Beacon Curriculum, will learn how to do it. It starts with comprehending a line of AI code. That's next. When you're ready and comfortable.

THE BEEF

the dot (.) in a line of AI code is read by a human and registers ..
.. for nominees: through the retina, optical nerve, into ..
.. for beacons: straight into your visual cortex ..
.. blocking out false ..

.. a beacon's consciousness contains no false, not as a construct, not as a toy ..

A line of AI is a concatenated string with dots. A computer processor uses an electronic clock signal to progress through the binary bits, nibbles, bytes. Hence, an electronic input buffer collects, say, eight bits to get a byte, and then offers that byte to the microchip's accessible connections. Processors are "over-clocked" by enthusiast hackers to achieve kudos. 

Similary, a line of AI stacks up the instructions for the electronic processor until a "critical stop" is reached. A critical stop is 

.(!]

This token sequence is fed to the processor input buffer like any other AI sequence, but it fires a circuit which releases the input buffer to the processor.

The input buffer is FIFO: first in first out. Thus, the system is little endian. Don't twist that and connect big endian. Processor remains passive.

For now, AI is stored as simple ASCII (american standard code for information interchange). An AI file starts with an AI header, which loads up other AI that is boilerplate code. These AI headers are linked, until you reach the code, which is not AI, that connects the computer you have created your AI on (your "console", for lack of a better word), with the outside world, where the target processor is located.
